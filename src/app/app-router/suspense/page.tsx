        You might expect adding a <code>Suspense</code> component would make
        navigation as fast as the Pages Router, but it&apos;s not quite the
        same. While navigation does become faster than in the previous demo,
        thereâ€™s still a slight delay between clicking the link and seeing the
        rendered page.
      </Description>
    </div>
  );
