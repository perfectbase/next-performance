            This demo uses the Pages Router. The traditional way of developing
            apps with Next.js. It can feel more straightforward to use.
            Especially if you&apos;re used to writing apps with vanilla React.
            However, it can get complicated when you start to use some features
            like caching, SSR, streaming, etc.

            <TextLink href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">App Router</TextLink>.
            Which is a newer way of developing apps with Next.js. It supports
            nested layouts, provides built-in solutions for loading states,
            error handling and data fetching. It defaults to server components
            and makes it easy to stream additional data from the initial page
            request.

          <Description>
            The page includes dynamic content fetched through an API, which
            takes about one second to load. With the Pages Router, data fetching
            logic needs to be handled client-side. For the App Router, data can
            be fetched directly within the server component, simplifying the
            code a bit.

          <Description>
            The dynamic content is wrapped in a{" "}
            <InlineCode>Suspense</InlineCode> component, which shows a loading
            spinner while data is fetched. The page doesn&apos;t make an extra
            request to get the dynamic contentâ€”the content is streamed from the
            initial page request itself.

            There is a <InlineCode>loading.tsx</InlineCode> file in this route
            segment. Loading files are cached and are displayed immediately when

          <Description>
            This demo uses the Edge Runtime, which is a faster runtime compared
            to the default Node.js runtime. It does not support all the node.js
            features and some libraries might not work as expected.

            is enabled. You might have noticed that the domain in this demo is
            different. This is because the client cache is a global
            configuration for the app. You can configure how long the cache
            should last for static and dynamic pages in the{" "}
            <InlineCode>next.config.ts</InlineCode> file. This demo is
            configured to cache dynamic pages for 30 seconds and static pages
            for 180 seconds, which was the default in Next.js 14. (Since Next.js
            15, the default is to not cache).

          <Description>
            The dynamic content is being cached on the server-side. The cache is
            shared between all users. Cache revalidation can be scheduled or
            triggered on demand. This demo is using{" "}

            content, but you might want to use the new experimental{" "}

            while streaming in dynamic content asynchronously.
